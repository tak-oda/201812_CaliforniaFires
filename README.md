Each tweet was classified into 'Bot' or 'Non-Bot' and then statistical analysis was conducted to gain insight into behavior of Bot.

## Data

## Scripts
### CaliforniaFire_DataPrep.ipynb
A python script to collect tweet and organize data set for statistical analysis

### CaliforniaFire_Analysis.rmd
A R Markdown file to read a dataset generated from python scripts and apply statistical analysis

## How to identify 'Bot'
‘Botometer’, a free API which is provided by a joint project of Indiana University and the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, was used.
